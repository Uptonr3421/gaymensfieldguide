title: About Gay Men's Field Guide
description: A queer-owned publication documenting tech, culture, business, and community care.

I’m **Upton Rand**, a Cleveland-based strategist, tinkerer, and essayist. Gay Men’s Field Guide started as a newsletter for friends comparing AI ethics notes and leather jacket care tips. It grew into a multilingual publication, podcast, and merch drop that funds mutual aid.

## What we publish

- Long-form essays about technology, sex, business, and health from a queer lens.
- Interviews with people who rebuild systems from the margins.
- Dispatches in English, Spanish, and French because the community has never been monolingual.

## How the shop works

There’s no warehouse. We run small-batch apparel with local printers, link out to Stripe Checkout for payments, and donate a slice of every launch to LGBTQ+ youth organizations in Ohio.

## Collaborations & speaking

Need a guest lecturer, strategist, or someone to moderate a conversation about equitable tech? Send a note to [hello@gaymensfieldguide.com](mailto:hello@gaymensfieldguide.com). Let’s build something that makes our people safer and louder.
