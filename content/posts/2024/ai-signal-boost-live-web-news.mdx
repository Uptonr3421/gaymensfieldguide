Everyone in the group chat wants the same thing: to know when a model drops, whether it is safe enough to deploy, and if the latency is good enough to keep the vibe intact. AI Signal Boost is our new live ticker for that exact loop. It is built to be read on a phone, swiped with one thumb, and shared inside co-op threads without leaking your secrets.

## What we monitor hourly

- **Model release pings.** We surface commit notes for Llama, Gemma, Phi, and the open-source scene with links to quantized builds.
- **Safety and alignment sweeps.** We flag jailbreak regressions, new filters, and reports from red-team collectives.
- **Latency health.** We chart edge-ready providers with a bias toward browser-friendly runtimes and low-eGPU footprints.

## Shareable without surveillance

The feed is simple HTML and JSON—no trackers, no third-party fonts. Copy the RSS endpoint into whatever automation you use. A compact, image-light version loads under 200ms on a midrange Android device.
