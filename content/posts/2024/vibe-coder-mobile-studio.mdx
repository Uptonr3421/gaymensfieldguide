We keep getting the same DM: “Can I manage evals and routing while I am on the train?” The answer should be yes. So we sketched the Vibe Coder mobile studio—a thumb-friendly set of tiles that let you peek at prompts, view drift alerts, and send co-op updates without loading a heavy dashboard.

## Patterns that work on 6-inch screens

- **Big hit targets.** Every card is at least 48px tall with generous padding and consistent rhythm.
- **Color-coded priorities.** Green for stability, blue for latency, violet for culture/community notes.
- **Offline friendly.** Critical cards cache the last successful payload so you can screenshot and share.

## Co-op status without noise

- Pager alerts roll up into a single badge; tap to expand details.
- Crew chat tiles surface only the last message, not the full thread, to reduce cognitive load.
- Eval pings can be snoozed for a set window so you can stay present in meetings.

## Try it with your stack

Prototype the layout in React Native or Expo, map the cards to your own API, and deploy with Node 20 runtimes. If you ship it, send a screenshot—we’ll feature the best implementations.
