The loudest voices in finance love chaos. They sell adrenaline, leverage, and newsletters with names like *Wolf Pack Alpha*. Meanwhile, queer founders and freelancers just want enough cushion to self-fund the next experiment without begging a VC who thinks "community" is a feature request.

Here’s the unpopular gospel: the boring stuff works. I automate transfers into a high-yield cash account every Monday, dollar-cost average into index funds each quarter, and hold a mix of municipal bonds that keep my studio rent paid. It’s not sexy, but neither is explaining to collaborators why payroll bounced.

## Cash is creative oxygen

My cash ladder covers six months of expenses plus a "surprise joy" fund for things like pressing a new zine or flying to Pride when the world feels heavy. Automation removes shame and makes saving feel like brushing teeth—mundane but life-saving.

## Diversify with values in mind

I still screen for funds that avoid the worst offenders and overweight climate tech, LGBTQ+-owned public companies, and boring utilities that actually send dividends. Values-aligned investing isn’t about perfection; it’s about knowing your money won’t undermine the world you’re trying to build.

## Set a quarterly money date

Every ninety days I review spending, rebalance, and delete any fintech that started acting like a casino. I write down how the portfolio performed *and* how it felt. If a position kept me awake, it goes. I’d rather ship a newsletter and sleep eight hours than refresh a meme stock at 1:00 a.m.

We deserve steadiness. Let the bros chase chaos; I’ll take compounding calm over dopamine any day.
