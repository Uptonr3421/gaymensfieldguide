Eval dashboards often feel like homework. The Realtime Eval Beat trims them into a one-screen snapshot: safety score, latency, and drift risk in clear language. The data refreshes every hour and stays light enough for spot-checking over LTE.

## The signals we keep

- **Safety evals.** We run canned prompts through your current model and show the pass/fail rate alongside guardrail notes.
- **Latency trend.** P95 and P99 values across your two fastest providers so you can reroute before the pager sings.
- **Model health.** A quick glance at guardrails, filters, and fallback rules in case of abuse or spike traffic.

## Shipping tips

- Keep the JSON feed cached on device; if you go offline, you still have the last known good state.
- Pair this with your logging stack; we already format timestamps for BigQuery and ClickHouse.
- Add your own prompts to the suite and send us a PR—we’ll roll them into the next drop.

## Why this matters

Edge deployments fail quietly. A minimal, mobile-first eval beat keeps you honest without requiring a MacBook and a desk. The best builders treat it like brushing teeth: two minutes a day, no excuses.
