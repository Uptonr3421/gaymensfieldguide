Most AI teams overbuild their deployment pipeline. This briefing keeps it light: Node 20, Vercel for shipping, and a rollback plan that lets you sleep. Everything is tuned for mobile-first UX so your readers and buyers get speed, not excuses.

## The pipeline

1. **Node 20 baseline.** Modern syntax, fetch improvements, and fewer polyfills on both edge and server.
2. **Vercel deploy hooks.** Prebuilt artifacts for production with `vercel --prebuilt` to keep cold starts minimal.
3. **Edge pods.** Route read-heavy or personalization endpoints to edge functions; keep heavy training on the server.

## Reliability checklist

- Traffic shadowing before every cutover.
- Rollback command prewritten and pinned in your ops runbook.
- Cached assets sized for mobile; SVG hero art and responsive images wherever possible.

## Ship it

Use this stack as a starter, then add the observability and auth your project needs. Keep the UX light, the assets optimized, and the deployments repeatable.
