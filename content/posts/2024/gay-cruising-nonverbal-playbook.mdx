Business school never taught me how to read an eyebrow raise from across a crowded boardroom. Queer nightlife did. Years of cruising taught us to watch for micro-signals, calibrate tone, and move with consent. Those skills translate directly to fundraising calls and creative reviews.

## Scan before you speak

Cruising taught me to pause at the door, take inventory, and clock the energy. In meetings I still do a visual sweep: who looks exhausted, who’s leaning in, who hasn’t said a word. That thirty-second scan changes how I open a conversation.

## Offer an easy out

Consent cues keep everyone safe. When I make a pitch, I build in graceful exits: "If this isn’t the right timeline, we can table it." Giving people permission to opt out makes them more likely to opt in—same rule as a club nod.

## Protect queer intuition

The corporate world tries to sand down our instincts with jargon. I treat queer intuition like IP. We already know how to sense tension, notice who’s excluded, and create safety. That’s strategy, not softness.

Cruising culture isn’t just history; it’s a leadership framework forged by necessity. Honor it and your meetings get a lot less awkward.
