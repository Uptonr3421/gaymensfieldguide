Stripe Atlas was supposed to save queer founders from paperwork purgatory. Instead, some of us walked away with Delaware franchise tax panic and no idea how to pay ourselves. Here’s what I wish someone had told me before I clicked purchase.

## The entity is only the beginning

Atlas sets up your LLC or C-Corp, but the moment documents hit your inbox you’re responsible for annual reports, foreign entity registration in your home state, and bookkeeping. Budget for an accountant immediately. The fee is cheaper than reinstating a dissolved company.

## Banking is smooth, compliance is not

Yes, you get a bank account quickly. No, that doesn’t mean local compliance disappears. If you sell merch in Ohio, you still need a vendor’s license and sales-tax filings. Atlas won’t remind you.

## Use the community wisely

The forums are only valuable if you participate. I’ve swapped contract templates, crisis comms advice, and even a photographer recommendation with other Atlas alums. Treat the Slack space like a co-op, not a help desk.

Atlas is a tool, not a miracle. Read the fine print, plan for ongoing costs, and remember that the real magic is still queer people taking care of each other.
