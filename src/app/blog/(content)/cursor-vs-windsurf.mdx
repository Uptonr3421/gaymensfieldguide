## The "Tab" Addiction

It started with GitHub Copilot. You press `Tab` to autocomplete a line. Cute.

Then came **Cursor**. You press `Command+K` and it writes the whole function.

Now comes **Windsurf**. It reads your mind, edits 12 files at once, and fixes the bugs it just created.

We are no longer writers. We are *Editors*.

## The Speed Gap

I tried to go back to "Vanilla" VS Code yesterday. It felt like running in molasses.

<SimulatorEngine type="code-race" title="HUMAN_VS_AI_SPEED_TEST" />

## The Contenders

I spent a week with each. Here is the breakdown.

### 1. GitHub Copilot (The OG)
It's just a plugin. It's polite. It stays in its lane.
*   **Vibe:** The helpful intern who sometimes hallucinates.
*   **Best feature:** It's everywhere.

### 2. Cursor (The Aggressive Fork)
They forked VS Code. They made it "AI Native." It feels like the editor is *alive*.
*   **Vibe:** The senior engineer who grabs your keyboard and types "Move over."
*   **Best feature:** `Composer` (Multi-file edits).

### 3. Windsurf (The New Challenger)
From Codeium. They call it "Flow." It tracks what you look at, not just what you type.
*   **Vibe:** The psychic mind-reader.
*   **Best feature:** Context awareness is scary good.

## The "Skill Rot" Problem

Here is the dark side.

If I stop paying my $20 subscription, **I can no longer do my job.**

My brain has offloaded the syntax for `React.useEffect` to the cloud. I don't remember how to center a div. I just type "make it pretty" and hit Enter.

We are becoming **Prompt Engineers** whether we like it or not.



<ResourceBalancer />


<ContextCollapse />

## Conclusion

**Cursor** wins today. It's just faster.

But **Windsurf** is watching.

    question: "Who actually owns Windsurf?", 
    answer: "It was built by Codeium. Rumors swirl about a 'Google Antigravity' acquisition for $2.4B, but the team remains independent for now. [Source: YCombinator News](https://news.ycombinator.com)"

    question: "Is Cursor just a VS Code fork?",

And **Vanilla VS Code**? RIP. You had a good run.
