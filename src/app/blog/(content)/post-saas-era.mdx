## The "Death by $10" Model

It used to be simple. You bought Photoshop for $600. You owned it for 10 years.
Now? You pay $20/month. Forever.

If you stop paying, you lose access to your own work.

We have moved from an **Ownership Economy** to a **Serfdom Economy**. We are sharecroppers on Adobe's land.

## The Math of "Forever"

I audited my credit card statement. It was a bloodbath.
$10 here. $5 there. $50 for a tool I opened once in March.

## The "Forever Stack"

The solution isn't to stop using software. It's to **Self-Host**.

2024 was the year Self-Hosting became easy.
*   **Coolify:** It's Vercel, but on your own $5 server.
*   **Obsidian:** Notes that live on *your* hard drive as text files.
*   **Immich:** Google Photos, but you own the hard drive.

Yes, it requires a tiny bit of technical skill. But the ROI is infinite.

## Conclusion

SaaS isn't evil. But it is lazy.
If you want to build something that lasts—something no CEO can turn off—you have to own the infrastructure.

Be the landlord, not the tenant.
