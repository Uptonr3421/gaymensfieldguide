## The "S" in IoT Stands for Security

Spoiler: There is no "S".

I bought a smart plug for $5 on AliExpress. It works great.
It also has a hardcoded root password (`admin` / `1234`) and an open Telnet port.

It is currently mining Monero for a guy named "Boris."

## Why Manufacturers Do This

It's economics.
*   **Chip:** $0.50
*   **WiFi:** $0.10
*   **Security Audit:** $50,000

Guess which one they skip?

They ship it, they forget it. And these "Zombies" sit on your network forever.

## The "Mirai" Botnet (and BadBox 2.0)

Remember when half the internet went down in 2016? That was Mirai.
It wasn't a supercomputer hack. It was 300,000 webcams and DVRs all shouting at once.

**Fast forward to 2025:**
*   **BadBox 2.0:** Infected 10 million Android-based TVs and set-top boxes.
*   **Vector:** Pre-installed malware in "budget" smart devices.
*   **Impact:** Your $30 streaming stick is now a node in a global DDoS cannon.

Your devices are weapons. You just aren't the one aiming them.

## Conclusion: Segregate or Die

If you must have a smart fridge (why?), treat it like a virus.
*   **VLANs:** Put IoT stuff on a separate Guest Network.
*   **Firewall:** Block them from the internet (they only need LAN).
*   **Dumb Devices:** Buy a normal fridge. Write a shopping list on paper.

The future is dumb. Stay unconnected.
