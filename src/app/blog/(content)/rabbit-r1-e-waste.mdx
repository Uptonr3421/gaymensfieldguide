## The "iPhone Killer" Lie

I wanted to love it.

The design? **Iconic.** Teenage Engineering don't miss.
The pitch? **Revolutionary.** An AI agent that uses apps for you.

**But then I opened the box.**

It felt cheap. Not "minimalist" cheap. *Happy Meal toy* cheap.
And when I turned it on? It hallucinated my Uber ride to a different state.

## The Teardown (Trigger Warning: Glue)
<ConflictBento

  items={[
    { label: "iFixit Score", value: "1 / 10" },
    { label: "Battery Access", value: "GLUED" },
    { label: "Screen Removal", value: "DESTRUCTIVE" }
  ]}
/>

I tried to open it to see what powered this "future."

**I fought. The glue won.**

There are no screws. Just clips and adhesive. To change the battery, you have to effectively destroy the back panel.

> **Manufacturer Logic:** "Batteries last forever, right?"
> **Physics Logic:** "No."

This device is not designed to be maintained. It is designed to be **consumed and discarded**.

## Why This Matters (The E-Waste Mountain)

Every year, we throw away **50 million tonnes** of e-waste.

The Rabbit R1 isn't just a bad product. It's a **bad precedent**. It normalizes "disposable compute."

        CRITICAL FAILURE: BACK_PANEL_SHATTERED. WARRANTY_VOID.
     </div>
  </div>
</InteractiveContainer>

## The "App" Conspiracy

Here is the dirty secret:

**The Rabbit R1 is just an Android app.**

People successfully extracted the APK and ran it on a standard Google Pixel. It worked fine. Better, actually.

You paid $200 for a dedicated button to run an app that could have been on your phone.

## Conclusion

Don't buy the hype. Don't buy the box.

If you want an AI agent, install ChatGPT on your phone.
If you want a retro orange fidget toy, buy a vintage Tamagotchi.

At least the Tamagotchi won't end up in a landfill in 6 months.
