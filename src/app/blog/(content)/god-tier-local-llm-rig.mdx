## The "VRAM" Bottleneck

Here is the secret Nvidia doesn't want you to know:
**Compute doesn't matter for LLMs. Memory bandwidth matters.**

You can have the fastest chip in the world, but if you can't fit the 70B model into memory, you're dead.

## The Math (Why 3090s Win)

A brand new RTX 4090 costs $1,800. It has 24GB VRAM.
A used RTX 3090 costs $700. It has 24GB VRAM.

**Do the math.**

For $1,400 (two used 3090s), you get **48GB of VRAM**.
That is enough to run Llama-3-70B at 4-bit quantization. A single 4090 cannot do this.

## The "VRAM" Quiz

Think you understand memory bandwidth?

<QuizEngine 
  title="VRAM_KNOWLEDGE_CHECK"
  type="game"
  questions={[
    {
      id: 1,
      text: "What happens when a model exceeds your VRAM?",
      options: [
        { label: "It runs slower (System RAM)", isCorrect: true, feedback: "Correct. It offloads to DDR4/5, which is 100x slower." },
        { label: "It crashes immediately", isCorrect: false },
        { label: "It deletes System32", isCorrect: false }
      ]
    }
  ]}
/>

## Building the Beast

You need a motherboard with widely spaced PCIe slots. You need a 1200W PSU. You need NVLink (if you can find it, though not strictly necessary for inference).

But when you fire it up? And you talk to a 70B parameter intelligence that lives entirely in your basement?

It feels like owning a nuclear weapon.

## Conclusion

Don't buy the shiny new thing. Buy the used enterprise gear.

VRAM is the only currency in the AI wars. Hoard it.
