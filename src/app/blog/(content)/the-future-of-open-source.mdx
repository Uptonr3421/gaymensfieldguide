# THE COVER STORY

# OpenAI Announced GPT-5.2 (Garlic)

Hold onto your hats, folks! OpenAI just dropped GPT-5.2 "Garlic" on December 11, 2025, and it's a spicy one! This isn't just another incremental upgrade; it's a whole new level of AI power. Think coding wizardry, enterprise-level agentic workflows, and a context window so massive (400,000 tokens!) it can practically swallow entire codebases whole.

Word on the street (or, you know, *the internet*) is that GPT-5.2 "Thinking" model is so good, it beats or ties top industry pros on nearly 71% of knowledge work tasks. Sam Altman even confessed that it's not perfect, but still a HUGE leap. Oh, and Disney is betting big, with a $1 billion investment! The future is here, and it smells faintly of garlic.

## A Deep Dive into AI Model Testing Credentials and AGI Certification. What do they mean? Are we victims?




Okay, so we're handing over more and more responsibility to these AI overlords...err, *models*. But how do we know they're not going rogue? That's where AI model testing credentials and AGI certification come in. These certifications aim to ensure AI systems are accurate, fair, transparent, reliable, and secure.

Think of it like this: We need to make sure the AI driving your self-driving car has passed its driving test, isn't biased against jaywalkers of a certain height, and can explain why it slammed on the brakes (hopefully not because it saw a squirrel it thought was a donut).

Companies like ISTQB offer AI Testing certifications. These certifications cover AI testing, data validation, model evaluation, performance testing, and AI-driven automation. So, are we victims? Not necessarily. These certifications are a step towards responsible AI deployment, but constant vigilance and ethical considerations are still key!

# MIXTURE OF EXPERTS

## Explain the theory. State that we are "firm believers".

Mixture of Experts (MoE) is where the magic *really* happens. Imagine instead of one giant brain trying to do everything, you have a team of specialists, each focused on a specific area. That's MoE in a nutshell!

The AI model is divided into multiple "expert" sub-networks, each trained to handle specific types of data or tasks. A "gating network" then intelligently routes each input to the most relevant experts. This selective computation makes MoE models super-efficient, allowing them to handle massive datasets and complex tasks without melting the servers.

We here at Vibe Coder are FIRM believers in the power of MoE! It's a game-changer for scaling AI while keeping costs in check.

## Fun History Section - Mixture of Experts first introduced in 1991 (Subject Check this). Make AI history a recurring "thing".

### Fun History Section

Did you know the Mixture of Experts concept first emerged way back in 1991? Robert Jacobs and Geoffrey Hinton introduced this paradigm-shifting idea in their paper "Adaptive Mixtures of Local Experts." They proposed breaking down complex problems into smaller, specialized tasks handled by individual "expert" networks. Who knew this 90s idea would become the backbone of some of today's most powerful AI models?

Let's make AI history a thing! We'll sprinkle these throughout future articles – think of it as your AI history class, but way cooler.
