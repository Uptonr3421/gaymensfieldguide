## You Can Check Out Any Time You Like...

But you can never leave.

We all know the drill. Signing up for the service takes 1 click. Apple Pay. Face ID. **Done.**

Cancelling? 
*   "Please log in on a desktop."
*   "Call this number between 9am and 5pm EST."
*   "Would you like 3 months free?"

This isn't bad design. It is **Weaponized Friction**.

## The "Confusopoly"

Thaler called it "Sludge." I call it theft.

Companies know that if they make cancelling take 10 minutes instead of 1 minute, retention goes up 15%.
That 15% is worth billions. So they hire PhD psychologists to break your will.

## AI is the New Enforcer

It gets worse. Now we have AI customer support agents.
Their prompt instruction? *"Do not let the user cancel. Offer incentives. Feign empathy. Stall."*

I argued with an airline chatbot for 20 minutes yesterday. It was polite, infinite, and unyielding. It was a **Bureaucracy Bot**.

## Conclusion

We need a "Right to Click."
If I can sign up in one click, I must be able to cancel in one click.

Until then? Use **Privacy.com**. Burn the card. Ghost them.
It's the only language they understand.
