## The 51% Threshold (Now 76%)

In 2024, bot traffic surpassed human traffic (51%). 
In 2025, reports suggest **76% of traffic on X (formerly Twitter)** is automated.

-   **Instagram:** ~95 Million fake accounts (9.5% of userbase).
-   **Scrapers:** Indexing your content for AI training.
-   **Credential Stuffers:** Trying to hack your users.
-   **SEO Spam Bots:** Trying to leave comments on your blog to sell Viagra.

The "Dead Internet Theory" used to be a conspiracy. Now it's just a server log analysis.

## The AI Echo Chamber

It gets worse. We are now training AI models on the internet. 

But the internet is full of AI-generated content (Spam blogs, LinkedIn posts, ChatGPT answers).

So we are training AI on AI. It's a photocopier making copies of copies. The quality degrades. The "Vibe" flattens.

## Why Authenticity is the Only Asset

If 90% of the internet is automated slop, **Human Proof** becomes the most valuable currency.

This is why Reddit is thriving (sued for training data or not). It's one of the last places where you can be reasonably sure (mostly) that `u/DeepFrier420` is a real person having a bad day, not a marketing bot.

(Okay, `u/DeepFrier420` is probably a bot too).

## Conclusion

The internet isn't dead. It's just undead. It's a zombie. 

To survive, you have to be overwhelmingly, undeniably, messily human. You have to make typos. You have to have bad takes. You have to have **Vibe**.

Bots don't have Vibe. Yet.
