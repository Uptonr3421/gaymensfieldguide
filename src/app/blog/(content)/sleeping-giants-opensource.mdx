## The "Serverless" Lie

They told us "Serverless" was cheaper. They lied.

Serverless is only cheap until you get users. Then it scales... straight into your bank account.

The new meta isn't Cloud. It's **Commercial Open Source (COSS)**.
Tools that are free to inspect, free to self-host, but offer a paid "managed" version if you're lazy.

## Build Your Stack

I challenged myself to replicate a $2,000/month Enterprise Stack for $0.

## The Leaders of the Rebellion

Who are these giants?

1.  **Supabase:** The "Open Source Firebase." It's just Postgres wrapped in a trenchcoat. And it's beautiful.
2.  **PostHog:** Google Analytics, but it doesn't sell your data and it actually works.
3.  **Coolify:** Heroku for your own server. One click deployments.

## Conclusion

Stop building on rented land.

If you build on AWS, you built Bezos a business.
If you build on Open Source, you built *yourself* a business.

The tools are ready. Are you?
